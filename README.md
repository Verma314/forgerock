My thoughts on various identiy and access management products by forgerock.

### Background: What is IAM?
According to [Yip et al](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/identity-management-a/9781583470930/)

*Managing identities in an organization is simply **organizing** the collection, storage, and disbursement of data specific to people within the organization and to persons and companies external to the organization, be they customers or suppliers. It is critical for organizations to put such management in place to avoid excessive costs and potential litigation.*

This is important so as to ensure 
- Authentication 
- Confidentiality  
- Data integrity (for safe data storage and dissemination)
- Non-repudiation. 

According to Wikipedia,

* Identity management (IdM == IAM) is the task of controlling information about users on computers.
* Identity Acess Management (IAM) refers to a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources.
*  Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate and authorize individuals who will be utilizing IT resources, but also the hardware and applications employees need to access. They are becoming increasingly prevelant because of *regulatory compliance requirements have become increasingly more rigorous and complex* 

It's needed for creating users, logging them in, services (personalized content) and identity federation (authentication without a password.)
