My thoughts on various identiy and access management products by forgerock.

### Background: What is IAM?
* Identity management (IdM == IAM) is the task of controlling information about users on computers. [from wiki]
* Identity Acess Management (IAM) refers to a framework of policies and technologies for ensuring that the proper people in an enterprise have the appropriate access to technology resources. [from wiki]
*  Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate and authorize individuals who will be utilizing IT resources, but also the hardware and applications employees need to access. They are becoming increasingly prevelant because of *regulatory compliance requirements have become increasingly more rigorous and complex* [from wiki]

It's needed for creating users, logging them in, services (personalized content) and identity federation (authentication without a password.)
